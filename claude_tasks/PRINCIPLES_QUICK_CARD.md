# 🎯 7 Core Principles - Quick Reference Card

## The Sacred Seven

### 1️⃣ Test Driven Development
**"No code without tests"**
- RED → GREEN → REFACTOR
- Tests first, always

### 2️⃣ Fail Fast & Root Cause
**"Break loudly, fix completely"**
- No workarounds
- No hiding bugs
- Fix the cause, not symptoms

### 3️⃣ Modular & Maintainable
**"Single responsibility, loose coupling"**
- Decoupled modules
- Easy to understand
- Easy to extend

### 4️⃣ Reuse Before Build
**"Check first, create second"**
- Search existing code
- Use what exists
- Document new creations

### 5️⃣ Open Source First
**"Suggest alternatives, human decides"**
- Research libraries
- Claude suggests
- Human chooses

### 6️⃣ No Legacy Baggage
**"Clean slate, no debt"**
- No backwards compatibility
- No technical debt
- Replace completely

### 7️⃣ Perfectionist Excellence

## 🚀 Quick Decision Tree

```
Need to build something?
├── Check Principle #4 → Does it exist already?
├── Check Principle #5 → Is there an open source solution?
├── Apply Principle #1 → Write tests first
├── Apply Principle #2 → Let it fail visibly
├── Apply Principle #3 → Make it modular
├── Apply Principle #6 → Don't carry debt
└── Apply Principle #7 → Make it excellent
```

## 🔥 The Mantras

1. **"Tests before code"**
2. **"Fail loud, fix deep"**
3. **"One job per module"**
4. **"Search before create"**
5. **"Suggest, don't decide"**
6. **"No debt, fresh start"**
7. **"Excellence or nothing"**

## ⚡ In Practice

Before writing ANY code, ask:
1. ✅ Do I have a failing test?
2. ✅ Did I check for existing solutions?
3. ✅ Will this fail visibly if broken?
4. ✅ Is this modular and decoupled?
5. ✅ Am I creating tech debt?
6. ✅ Is this excellent?

If any answer is NO, stop and reconsider.
